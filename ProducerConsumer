/*
* The below code has bug fixed and replaces the if condition with a while loop
* in the Consumers code.
* Whenever a producer adds an item, say two consumer threads will try to acquire the lock,
* but there is just 1 item, which is removed by first thread. So when second thread tries to acquire the 
* lock, there is no item in the queue. Replacing an if with a while loop will do.
